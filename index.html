          <h3>Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
          As a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://humblebee.ai" style="text-decoration: none;">Humblebee.ai</a>, I have developed network and malware analysis tools using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance security. I've led Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects for text classification and efficient chatbot deployment, improving both automation and user interaction.
          <br><br>
          My work has further extended to pioneering the use of Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing product functionalities and streamlining complex processes. This advanced application of AI technologies ensures robust, innovative solutions that keep pace with industry demands.

          <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
          I contributed to collecting, sorting, and preprocessing data for a company to build an Uzbek GPT language model, and I am proud of my work. Despite the challenge of gathering sufficient data, I used various techniques to improve the quality of the data and prepare it for use in training the model. My contribution was crucial in enabling the company to build an accurate and robust language model that can be used for a wide range of applications. I believe that this project has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of people in Uzbekistan and beyond, by bridging the digital divide and bringing the benefits of AI to more people around the world. Overall, I am pleased with the work that I contributed to this project and am excited to see the impact it will have in the future.</div>

          <h3>Professor Assitant</h3>
          As a Professor Assistant, I collaborated with the professor on various academic tasks, including conducting research, preparing course materials, grading assignments, and holding office hours for student consultations. Through this role, I gained a deep understanding of the subject matter and was able to effectively communicate it to students, as well as provide guidance and support to help them achieve their academic goals. Additionally, I contributed to the development of new course materials and research projects, which allowed me to apply my subject matter expertise and contribute to advancing knowledge in the field.

          My experience as a Professor Assistant has allowed me to develop valuable skills in research, teaching, and academic administration. Specifically, I have honed my ability to work collaboratively with others, manage multiple tasks simultaneously, and communicate complex ideas to diverse audiences. I am excited to apply these skills and my passion for learning to my future endeavors.
