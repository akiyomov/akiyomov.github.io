          <h3>Backend Engineer</h3>
          As a Backend Engineer at <a href="https://huntedhive.com" style="text-decoration: none;">HuntedHive</a>, I specialize in creating APIs using Django and Flask that effectively communicate with chatbots, providing users with a seamless experience. My responsibilities include running LLM and GPT-based models to improve chatbot performance, and leveraging OpenAI to optimize responses. I am also skilled in deploying microservices and big models, ensuring that the chatbot runs without interruption.
        <br><br>
        In addition, I use Celery to manage asynchronous tasks, such as sending emails or processing large datasets. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies in the field and continuously improving my skills. My proficiency in deploying microservices and big models ensures that the chatbot runs without interruption, providing reliable service to users.

          <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
          I contributed to collecting, sorting, and preprocessing data for a company to build an Uzbek GPT language model, and I am proud of my work. Despite the challenge of gathering sufficient data, I used various techniques to improve the quality of the data and prepare it for use in training the model. My contribution was crucial in enabling the company to build an accurate and robust language model that can be used for a wide range of applications. I believe that this project has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of people in Uzbekistan and beyond, by bridging the digital divide and bringing the benefits of AI to more people around the world. Overall, I am pleased with the work that I contributed to this project and am excited to see the impact it will have in the future.</div>
